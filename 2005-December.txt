Subject: [Bf-dev-announce] We have a website now
Message-ID: <439B09B0.6040109@inode.at>

Today we have set up a wiki which will be used as an interactive 
web-platform for exchanging information regarding our product, Brainfuck 
Studio. It is still under heavy construction, but already visible to 
every visitor. More content will be inserted during the next two weeks...
